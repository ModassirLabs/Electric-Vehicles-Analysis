### **Features**

1. **Total Vehicle Overview**:
   - The dashboard provides an overview of the total number of vehicles, including the breakdown between different EV types (e.g., PHEVs).
   - It also displays the average electric range of the vehicles, offering insights into the performance of EVs in terms of their range per charge.

2. **Trend Analysis by Model Year**:
   - Visualize the yearly trend in the number of electric vehicles in the dataset, allowing users to track how the adoption of PHEVs has evolved.
   - The graph makes it easy to compare the number of vehicles over multiple years and identify any significant changes in EV adoption.

3. **State-wise Distribution**:
   - The state distribution map highlights where most EVs are located, helping users identify regions with higher adoption rates.
   - This section provides a detailed look at the spread of PHEVs across different states and the relative concentration of vehicles in those areas.

4. **Manufacturer Performance**:
   - This section ranks the top EV manufacturers by the total number of vehicles released in the dataset, giving users insights into which manufacturers are leading the EV market.
   - The dashboard includes a breakdown of vehicle data by make, enabling a deeper understanding of which companies dominate the PHEV market.

5. **CAFV Eligibility**:
   - Displays the percentage of vehicles eligible as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFV) and those that are not eligible.
   - Helps users analyze the impact of CAFV eligibility on the distribution and adoption of EVs.

6. **Vehicle Model Breakdown**:
   - The dashboard includes detailed data on the top EV models, along with the percentage share of each model in the dataset.
   - This allows users to see which models are most popular within the PHEV category and analyze their market share.
